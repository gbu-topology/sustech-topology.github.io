<h3>Talks in Fall 2021 (mostly Mondays 4:20&ndash;5:10, zoom: 846 6434 3534)</h3>

                    <i>In and around stable homotopy groups of spheres</i></a><br />
                <div id="1" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    The computation of stable homotopy groups of spheres is one of the most fundamental problems in topology.  
                    Despite its simple definition, it is notoriously hard to compute.  It has connections to problems in many 
                    areas of mathematics, such as the problem of smooth structures on spheres.  In this talk, I will discuss 
                    a recent breakthrough on this computation, which depends on motivic homotopy theory in a critical way.  
                    This talk is based on several joint works with Bogdan Gheorghe, Dan Isaksen, and Guozhen Wang.

                    From physics perspective, Gukov(-Pei)-Putrov-Vafa have introduced a non-perturbative definition of complex 
                    Chern-Simons invariants of a 3-manifold, which is called BPS q-series.  Although its mathematical definition 
                    is not given yet, it exhibit remarkable mathematical properties: (non-semisimple) TQFT structure, modularity, 
                    cyclotomic expansions.  In this talk, I will survey the recent development of the BPS q-series.

                    <i>Algebraic topology of 24 dimensional string manifolds</i></a><br />
                <div id="3" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    String can be viewed as higher version of spin, while the latter plays a fundamental role in Atiyah-Singer 
                    index theory.  People try to develop parallel theory for string, the full story of which is still mystery.  
                    Geometry and topology of string manifolds then attract increasing attentions and interests, while the ones 
                    of dimensional 24 are quite special among string manifolds.
                    
                    In this talk, we will discuss the algebraic-topological aspect of 24-dimensional string manifolds, 
                    following the work of Hirzebruch, Ochanine, Landweber-Stong, Mahowald-Hopkins, Chen-Han, and very recent 
                    work of mine joint with Fei Han.  We will talk about string cobordism, various index-theoretic genera and 
                    some applications.

                <div id="4" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    It is a classical topic to study structures of certain special points on complex smooth cubic plane curves, 
                    for example, the 9 flex points and the 27 sextactic points.  We consider the following topological question 
                    asked by Farb: Is it true that the known algebraic structures give all the possible ways to continuously 
                    choose n distinct points on every smooth cubic plane curve, for each given positive integer n?  This work is 
                    joint with Ishan Banerjee.

                <div id="5" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    Classical Steenrod algebra is one of the most fundamental algebraic gadgets in stable homotopy theory.  
                    It led to the theory of characteristic classes, which is key to some of the most celebrated applications 
                    of homotopy theory to geometry.  The G-equivariant Steenrod algebra is not known beyond the group of 
                    order 2.  In this talk, I will recall a geometric construction of the classical Steenrod algebra and 
                    generalize it to construct G-equivariant Steenrod operations.  Time permitting, I will discuss potential 
                    applications to equivariant geometry.

                    <i>Topology and number theory</i></a><br />
                <div id="6" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    Number theory is the study of completely discrete things that can be 
                    counted or numbered, while topology is the study of continuous things
                    and of properties that are not changed by deformation.  So it is
                    perhaps surprising that questions of pure topology lead to surprisingly
                    subtle questions of number theory.   In this talk I will sketch several
                    instances of this phenomenon, starting with Euler's discovery that a
                    discrete invariant (now called the Euler characteristic) of a
                    topological space can be computed by triangulating it any way, and then
                    move on to more sophisticated examples: the "Betti numbers" of a
                    manifold (roughly speaking, the number of k-dimensional "holes"  for
                    each integer k up to the dimension of the manifold), the appearance of
                    Bernoulli numbers in connection with so-called exotic spheres in higher
                    dimensions, the appearance of Dedekind sums (another simple
                    number-theoretical object going back to the 19th century) in the study
                    of 4-dimensional manifolds, and most recently a whole series of
                    discoveries relating "quantum invariants" of knots to various deep
                    number-theoretical concepts (units, K-theory, Bloch groups, Habiro
                    ring,...). This last is ongoing research in collaboration with Stavros
                    Garoufalidis in SUSTech. The talk will be at a very general level and
                    will not require any prior knowledge.  In particular, rough
                    explanations of all of the various technical words occurring above will
                    be given. <br />
                    
                    In the Math Center seminar talk that I will give on December 6, I will
                    tell more about one of the specific questions appearing above, namely,
                    the question of the possible Betti numbers that can occur for smooth
                    n-dimensional manifolds.  The answer here turns out to involve
                    elementary but quite hard number theory, and is quite amusing.  This
                    talk, too, is meant to be understandable by good undergraduates or by
                    mathematicians in all fields.

                <div id="7" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                    In this talk, I will explain the work "Topological modular forms and the absence of all heterotic global 
                    anomalies" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13542" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13542</a>) 
                    with Yuji Tachikawa from a mathematical point of view.  That work is aimed at settling a physical problem to 
                    show the vanishing of anomalies in heterotic string theories.  We translate the problem into a mathematical 
                    problem to show that a certain transformation of generalized cohomology theories from TMF (Topological 
                    Modular Forms) to the Anderson dual to String bordism vanishes, and prove that it is indeed the case.  Here, 
                    the Anderson dual of a generalized homology theory plays the crucial role in the classification of anomalies 
                    by a conjecture of Freed and Hopkins.  I will also explain this point, as well as related works on the 
                    Anderson duals.
